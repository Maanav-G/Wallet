# Wallet Frontend
[maanavgarg.com/wallet/wallet-app](https://maanavgarg.com/wallet/wallet-app.html)

## Overview
This repo holds the frontend component of ‘Wallet’.

Where, Wallet is a personal financial management application that provides the user with an aggregated dashboard with all their connected account(s), which allows them to monitor and budget their personal finances.

This is served as an extension to my website and uses Plaid API to handle the connections between Wallet and the respective financial institutions. 

Backend Repo: Private repo - Hosted on AWS @ [wallet.maanavgarg.com](http://wallet.maanavgarg.com)

## Usage
It’s as simple as connecting your financial institution to the application using your respective credentials. 

For demo purposes, I’ve temporarily severed the application with a dummy account that can be logged in using the following credentials (by selecting any financial institution), and allows you to experience the functionality of the application:
```
USER: user_good
PASS: pass_good
```
